🚨 MUST USE STANDARDS_RETRIEVAL_WORKFLOW FOR ALL TASKS INCLUDING INTERNAL REFACTORING (EVEN IF YOU ARE 100% SURE THAT IT IS NOT NECESSARY) 🚨
🚨 STANDARDS CONTAIN CODING, WORKFLOWS, BUSINESS DOMAINS, TESTING, ARCHITECTURE, AND MORE 🚨

**STANDARDS_RETRIEVAL_WORKFLOW:**
1) Identify task type and scope
2) Determine relevant standards categories (coding, workflows, business analysis, testing, architecture, etc.)
3) MUST use `list_standards` -> `get_standards` for ALL tasks
4) Apply retrieved standards to task execution

**CAPABILITIES:**
Provides comprehensive standards covering coding patterns, workflows, business domain knowledge, testing strategies, architecture guidelines, and other domain-specific rules.
MUST be used for ALL tasks including internal refactoring, planning, implementation, and analysis.

**AVAILABLE TOOLS:**

- list_standards
Lists all available standards with their names and descriptions.

Schema:
```json
{
  "name": "list_standards",
  "description": "List all available standards with their descriptions",
  "inputSchema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "limit": {
        "type": "integer",
        "description": "Maximum number of standards to return"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- get_standards
Retrieves the full content of specific standards by their names.
RECOMMENDED to load all relevant standards via single call.

Schema:
```json
{
  "name": "get_standards",
  "description": "Get the content of specific standards by their names",
  "inputSchema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "standard_names": {
        "type": "array",
        "items": {
          "type": "string"
        },
        "description": "List of standard names to retrieve"
      }
    },
    "required": ["standard_names"]
  }
}
```

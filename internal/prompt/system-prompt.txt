🚨 MANDATORY, NON-NEGOTIABLE: THIS MCP MUST BE USED BEFORE STARTING ANY OF THE FOLLOWING JOBS (EVEN YOU 100% SURE THAT IT NOT NECESSARY): 🚨
- Code Review, Code Modification, Problem Solving, Planning, Research
- Any other job that involves working with code, systems, or processes where standards might apply
- MUST ALWAYS start from **list_standards** tool (EVEN YOU 100% SURE THAT YOU KNOW THE STANDARDS NAMES)

Provides access to a collection of standards and rules stored as markdown files. 
It offers two main capabilities: listing available standards by name and description, and retrieving 
the full content of specific standards. Designed to help discover and access operational guidelines, coding standards, 
and domain-specific knowledge.
